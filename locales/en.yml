      copy: "An elevated design expression"
    overview:
      header: "Design Overview"
      copy: "When design is measured by the rules it breaks instead of the ones it follows; by the conventions it defies, instead of those it embraces; and by the assumptions it challenges, rather than the ones it confirms; it is free to adapt form and function to new purposes - yours."
    exterior:
      header: "Exterior 360"
      copy: "For a view of the Q50 from every angle, swipe to rotate."
    headlights:
      header: "Adaptive Headlamps"
      copy: "Expressive Illumination - Its gaze is unmistakable. A unique expression of design centered around twin, multi-mode LED headlamps, accented by daytime running lights. Adapting intelligently to changing lighting demands, illuminating in fading daylight or with SmartBeam Assist independently turning off the driver or passenger side high beam for oncoming night time headlights. Proceeding with the appropriate lighting response instead of demanding it of you."
    seating:
      header: "Luxury Seating"
      copy: "A breakthrough in ergonomic design, these luxuriously crafted seats provide optimal upper body support for total driver comfort. So the only thing you feel is the visceral connection between driver and car. [1]"
    interior:
      header: "Intuitive Interior"
      copy: "Intuitive Interior - Meticulously hand-polished maple wood trim. Artisan-stitched leather-appointed upholstery. Artistically balanced textures. Intelligent Display instrumentation. And every element - for convenience or control -  intuitively located. All beautifully framed by a distinctive double-wave dash that surrounds each occupant in an embrace of personal comfort. Welcome to a world of luxury centered entirely around you, whether you’re behind the wheel, or just along for the drive."

    handling:
      header: "Zero-lift Aerodynamics"
      copy: "Harness The Wind - Traditionally the enemy of performance, wind can now also be an ally. Designed with zero-lift aerodynamics, Q50's upper and lower body specifically direct the flow of air over, around and under the vehicle, ensuring stable and predictable handling throughout the speed range. Combined with a stiffer suspension, this holistic approach to aerodynamics helps to reduce the effects of wind turbulence - even at motorway speeds - for an enhanced feeling of grip and control."

      copy: "The Q50 Sport Model - It makes its entrance with a signature sport bumper and unique air-dam. 19” split-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels, each endowed with sport pistons and rotors for pure stopping power, are precisely contained within their arched wells. But this Infiniti is designed to move. And from the moment its sport leather-appointed seats embrace you, you’re just a magnesium paddle-shift away from seven visionary dimensions of performance."

    engines:
      header: "Engines"
      copy: "Yours to choose: The exhilarating performance of Infiniti's Direct Response Hybrid System that combines the power of the 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine with the efficiency boosting electric motor – or the responsive 2.2-litre turbo charged 4-cylinder diesel engine that delivers 170 PS with less than 115g/km CO2 emissions. Whichever you choose, one thing’s for certain – you won’t need to compromise between performance and efficiency. [1]"      
    hybrid:
      header: "Performance Hybrid"
      copy: "Performance Hybrid - A sublime fusion of power and efficiency, this drivetrain produces pulse-racing takeoffs and sustained straightaway muscle for performance that is, in a word, electrifying. Conventional luxury cars resort to larger engines to improve performance. The Q50 Hybrid uses a Lithium-Ion battery to unleash a torrent of supplementary power when accelerating. This power is channeled through its Intelligent Dual Clutch to deliver full-torque performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency. Even more amazing, the system partially recharges itself every time you step on the brakes."

    steering:

      copy: "Direct Adaptive Steering - Control. Precision. Adaptability. Handling’s triple-crown. Now, after over ten years of research and development, it is firmly within reach. This world's first system uses electronics to streamline the steering mechanism for a more precise feeling behind the wheel. Over rough or uneven roads, this moderates the need for constant, subtle adjustment, imparting a commanding feeling of stability while helping shield the driver from excessive road vibrations."

    drivemodes:
      header: "Personalised Drive Modes"
      copy: "Personalised drive modes - Infiniti’s ground-breaking Direct Adaptive Steering system, lets you customise your ride with three driver-selectable steering modes. Choose Sport or Standard modes to reflect the needs of the drive or simply your mood. And in Custom mode, steering effort and response can be personalised, freeing you to command the road on your terms. [2]"

When in reverse, BCI helps detect crossing vehicles and objects behind the vehicle and signals the driver with visual and audible alerts. If necessary, BCI goes further by automatically engaging the brakes to help avoid a collision. [3]"
